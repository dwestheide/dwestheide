### Hæ! 👋

I'm Daniel, a software engineer from Berlin, Germany. I'm a senior consultant at [INNOQ](https://innoq.com) and co-organizer of ScalaBridge Berlin, the Berlin chapter of the [ScalaBridge](https://scalabridge.org/) organization.

I care about empathy and inclusivity, and about the ethical, social, and ecological consequences of our work.

📚 I have written three books about Scala, one of them still being a work in progress:

- [The Neophyte's Guide to Scala](https://leanpub.com/theneophytesguidetoscala)
- [Scala from Scratch: Exploration](https://leanpub.com/scala-from-scratch-exploration)
- [Scala from Scratch: Understanding](https://leanpub.com/scala-from-scratch-understanding)

📔 I have a [blog](https://danielwestheide.com/blog/) where I write about functional programming and other things related to making software. Here are a few of the most popular articles:

- [The Empathic Programmer](https://danielwestheide.com/blog/the-empathic-programmer/)
- [The Complexity Trap: Think Before You Leap](https://danielwestheide.com/blog/the-complexity-trap/)
- [Put your writes where your master is: Compile-time restriction of Slick effect types](https://danielwestheide.com/blog/put-your-writes-where-your-master-is-compile-time-restriction-of-slick-effect-types/)
  
📛 I have been doing quite a few [talks](https://danielwestheide.com/talks/) at conferences at meetups, in recent times also remotely/online.  

Here's some interesting facts about me that are unrelated to work and tech:

- ☕ I'm a bit of a coffee snob
- 🇮🇸 I'm learning Icelandic
- 🎭 I play pen&paper roleplaying and story games

## ❤️ Support
